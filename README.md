Alchemelody
Alchemelody is an innovative approach to learning how to "play music by ear," blending ancient concepts with modern technology. Designed as a unique "bio-hack" for the human subconscious, Alchemelody combines the principles of planetary hours with auditory and visual stimuli to teach users how to sing, write music, and harmonize effortlessly.

This app serves as a planetary hours calculator, dynamically determining the current planetary hour based on the user's location. Each hour is associated with a specific celestial body, and Alchemelody goes beyond simple calculations by integrating these concepts into an interactive experience:

Alarm Clock Integration: Sounds a corresponding tone for the current planetary hour, providing an auditory cue to sync your internal rhythm with the celestial cycles.
Visual Stimuli: Flashes the corresponding color of the planetary hour across the screen, reinforcing the association between sound, color, and the subconscious.
Digital Tarot Card for Music: Acts as a modern-day tarot, teaching users how to sing and write music by tapping into intuitive, subconscious methods of learning.
Whether you're an aspiring musician, a spiritual seeker, or just curious about harmonizing with the cosmos, Alchemelody offers a powerful, interactive tool to unlock your musical potential while connecting with the rhythms of the universe.
